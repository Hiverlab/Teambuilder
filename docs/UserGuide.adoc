== Introduction

Team Builder was inspired by office tools adopted by Bridgewater Associates, one of the largest investment management
companies in America. Their CEO and founder, Ray Dalio, heavily emphasises on radical transparency and algorithmic
decision when it comes to managing a company.

One such tool that inspired us was the “Baseball cards”, a profiling tool that highlights a person’s strengths and their
characteristics. Along with a “combiner” feature, the tool will be able to compare and analyses the key characteristics
of each employee. It will help you to find the right person for the job based on their strengths.

Thus, with that, Team Builder was created with the aim of improving the allocation of human resources to projects at
Hiverlab. With the Gallup StrengthsFinder test in mind, Team Builder aims to delegate desirable team members in an efficient
manner by leveraging on one another’s strengths.
