== Introduction

_TeamBuilder_ was inspired by office tools adopted by Bridgewater Associates, one of the largest investment management
companies in America. Their CEO and founder, Ray Dalio, heavily emphasises on radical transparency and algorithmic
decision when it comes to managing a company.

One such tool that inspired us was the “Baseball cards”, a profiling tool that highlights a person’s strengths and their
characteristics. Along with a “combiner” feature, the tool will be able to compare and analyse the key characteristics
of each employee. It will help you to find the right person for the job based on their strengths.

Thus, with that, _TeamBuilder_ was created with the aim of improving the allocation of human resources to projects at
Hiverlab. With the Gallup StrengthsFinder test in mind, _TeamBuilder_  aims to delegate desirable team members in an
efficient manner by leveraging on one another’s strengths.

== Features
This section describes the various features utilised by _TeamBuilder_.

=== Combiner
After selecting your options, you will then be redirected to a page ...

=== Upcoming Features

==== Login System `[yellow]#[coming in v2.0]#`
Implementing a login system will definitely make _TeamBuilder_ more secure.
This is especially important as personal information is concerned.

==== More sophisticated requirements when filling up form `[yellow]#[coming in v2.0]#`
Users would be able to specify other variables such as number of people they would want to have in a team,
instead of the default value of 3 people generated per team for now. This will allow for more flexibility in what kinds
of teams can be generated using this system.

==== Enhanced Algorithm `[yellow]#[coming in v2.0]#`
For future iterations of this product, we can explore to have a more complicated algorithm that takes into account how
busy each individual is - ie. refrain from overloading people with too many projects. Additionally, we can also take
into consideration the chemistry/compatibility between members if possible. However, this extension would probably
require the help of artificial intelligence (AI).

==== Integration of Trello board into the system `[yellow]#[coming in v2.0]#`
Since the team mostly relies on the Trello Board when it comes to keeping track of projects, it is desirable if the
company’s Trello boards can be integrated into the system itself. This will allow for easier referral of what the
current projects are and possibly play a part in helping with the assignment of teams.

== FAQ

{bl}

*Q*: [navy]#How do I transfer my data to another Computer?#

*A*: You can install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file
that contains the data of your previous _In-Credit-Ble_ folder.

*Q*: [navy]#Will the application support different currency?#

*A*: At the current version, the application is unable to support transactions record in different currency.
You will need to calculate and enter your input based on your local currency.

_In-Credit-Ble_  aims to support multi-currency transactions in `[yellow]#v2.0#`.
