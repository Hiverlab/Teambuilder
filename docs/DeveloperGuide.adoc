== Introduction
This Bridgewater tool _TeamBuilder_ was inspired by office tools adopted by Bridgewater Associates, one of the largest
investment management companies in America. Their CEO and founder, Ray Dalio, heavily emphasises on radical transparency
and algorithmic decision when it comes to managing a company.

One such tool that inspired us was the “Baseball cards”, a profiling tool that highlights a person’s strengths and their
characteristics. Along with a “combiner” feature, the tool will be able to compare and analyse the key characteristics
of each employee. It will help you to find the right person for the job based on their strengths.

Thus, with that, _TeamBuilder_ was created with the aim of improving the allocation of human resources to projects at
Hiverlab Pte Ltd. With the Gallup StrengthsFinder test in mind, _TeamBuilder_ aims to delegate desirable team members in
an efficient manner by leveraging on one another’s strengths.

This developer guide specifies the design and implementation of _TeamBuilder_. The intended audience of this document is
the developers, designers and software testers of our application.

== Setting Up

Before starting, ensure that you check you have the following installed:

* Node.js
* Npm (Node package manager)
* Angular

If you have installed all of the following, you may skip the following steps listed below.

1. Install Node.js and npm by typing npm install  in your terminal/console window. This step is important as it will be
needed in the installation of Angular. If you are interested, the link to Angular’s documentation is included here.
2. To install Angular, enter `npm install -g @angular/cli`
3. Run the application by going into the root folder `cd my-app`
4. Enter `ng serve --open`
5. Lastly, download the project from Github https://github.com/geezlouisee/bridgewater[here].

[NOTE]
If you encounter an error pointing towards `node_modules/bootstrap/scss/_forms.scss` (line 247), remove the last argument
so you should get something like this:

.Edit the code accordingly to only contain 2 arguments

== Design

_TeamBuilder_ is designed to be a web app, implemented using an Angular framework. More details on its implementation will
be provided in Chapter 4.

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

Angular is largely based on the Model-View-Controller (MVC) framework.
We decided to choose this framework as it makes it convenient for front-end testing for _TeamBuilder_.

.Architecture Diagram of _TeamBuilder_
image::architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* above explains the high-level design of _TeamBuilder_.
Given below is a quick overview of each component.

* *Model*: Corresponds to all data-related logic that the user works with.
* *View*: Used for the UI logic of the application. This includes the html/css files.
* *Controller*: Acts as an interface between Model and View components, it manipulates data using the Model component
and interact with the Views to render the final output. This includes the service component in our application.

Additionally, due to the Angular framework, the architecture of _TeamBuilder_ is also largely component-based.
Each component consists of some metadata, an HTML template and logic - all of which controls a patch of screen called a view.

Below shows a brief diagram consisting of all the components in this application.

== Implementation

TeamBuilder was made using HTML/CSS/TS and is largely implemented based on the Angular framework.
This framework was chosen to make the code cleaner, as compared to not using any Javascript frameworks at all.

This section describes in detail the implementation of certain features in _TeamBuilder_.

=== HTML/CSS
TeamBuilder was made using a free template that is already supported by Angular by Creative Tim.
Their source code can be found https://demos.creative-tim.com/paper-kit-2-angular/#/home[here].

=== Angular/TS
Angular primarily uses TypeScript (TS), which is a superset of JavaScript (JS) that supports type safety and tooling.
TypeScript has to be “transpiled” into JavaScript using the tsc compiler, as browsers cannot execute TypeScript directly.

Although TypeScript is not widely supported by most browsers, the polyfills.ts file that you see in the root `src` folder
helps to fill in the gaps between the JS needed by the system features versus the JS version supported by most browsers,
ECMAScript5 (ES5).

_More details to be filled in soon..._

=== Combiner
The Combiner will be implemented as a component in Angular and works like a point system,
serving as the main logic/algorithm of _TeamBuilder_.

.Activity Diagram of how User interacts with the Combiner
image::combinerAlgo.png[width="600"]

This is the brief algorithm of how the Combiner works:

1) There will be one main list of Person objects containing all employees of Hiverlab.

2) User of _TeamBuilder_ will first specify the weightage (in %) of Skill Sets vs Gallup Strengths they would like the system to consider.
   If not specified, the default value will be 50-50.

.User can specify the desired weightages via the slider
image::slider.gif[width="600"]

3) User then specifies the type of the project. The list of the various types of projects are as shown below:

.List of the Different Project Types
image::projectList.png[width="400"]

4) Based on the category which the user selects, generate the same number of lists as the relevant gallup strengths.
These lists will also contain similar content to the Person objects, but instead the objects have the name,
gallup strength value and total score, sorted in descending order based on the strength value.

****
**Example:**

Select “Developing Storyhive”, 2 sorted lists for `Strategic` and `Executing` will be created.
****

.Project Types with their Associated Suitable Gallup Strengths
image::projectGallup.png[width="600"]

****
**This part KIV:**

Award ppl points based on their ranking, this contribute to `[red]#x%#` of their total score
If have 2 strengths, then take turns in choosing from both lists(then % for each gallup strength contributes to [red]#(x/2)%#?) KIV
****

5) Afterwards, user will also choose the relevant skills they would require for this project, as shown below:

.User can specify the desired skill sets required by the project
image::skillsets.png[width="400"]

6) The system will also have another list (ie. a skillmap) contain the percentages of everyone’s skills.
Based on the skills that have been indicated by the user, the total score of all skills indicated for each individual will be tallied.
This will account for `[red]#y%#` of the user’s total score.

7) The total score for everyone will then be tabulated, where

****
`Total score = x%(gallup score) + y%(skills score) (where x + y = 100)`
****

8) Lastly, everyone will be ranked according to their total scores in descending order (highest - lowest).
   The first 3 will be grouped together, followed by the next 3, until 3 groups have been formed.

=== Adding a New Project Category
In order to add a new category, there will be quite a few files that you will have to edit:

1) To add a new category, edit the `categories` array in line 18 of `form.component.ts` accordingly.
   `name` refers to the project category, whilst `value` refers to the Gallup strengths associated with that particular category.

.Add in your desired category in `form.component.ts` in the respective array accordingly
image::formcomponent.PNG[width="450"]

Remember to edit any existing persons in your `.json` file accordingly
(You may refer to Section 4.6 on how to edit/access the `.json` file.)

=== Adding a New Skill
Adding a new skill is similar to adding a new category, but the files required to be changed are slightly different.

1) To add a new category, edit the `skills` array in line 25 of `form.component.ts` accordingly.
   `name` refers to the specific skill, `field` refers to the term used to refer to the skill set in your code, and `maxValue` refers to the total score tallied for the particular skill set.

.Add in your desired category in `form.component.ts` in the respective array accordingly
image::formcomponent.PNG[width="450"]

2) Go to `form-model.ts` and add in the skill set accordingly in the constructor of `FormModel`.
The term used should be the same as the `field` specified in the previous step. Specify the field type accordingly.

.Add in the desired skill in `form-model.ts` accordingly
image::formmodel.PNG[width="300"]

3) Update the `formModel` object in line 34 of `form.component.ts` accordingly to include your newly added skill set.

.Edit number of boolean parameters in line 34 of `form.component.ts` accordingly
image::booleanarray.PNG[width="550"]

4) Update the fields in `person.ts` accordingly to include your newly added skill set.

.Edit `person.ts` accordingly
image::person.PNG[width="300"]

Remember to edit any existing persons in your `.json` file accordingly
(You may refer to Section 4.6 on how to edit/access the `.json` file.)

=== Adding a new person
The list of employees in Hiverlab are stored as Person objects in a JSON file.
The data includes the person's name, complete with their scores for the Gallup Strengths and skill sets respectively.

1. Access `src` > `assets` > `hiverlab.json`.
2. Add in the new person by creating a new Person object, whilst following the format below:

.Edit `hiverlab.json` accordingly
image::editpersons.PNG[width="500"]

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.


[.text-justify]
=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation
See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format
We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select menu:Open With[Google Chrome].
.  Within Chrome, click on the btn:[Print] option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to btn:[Save as PDF], then click btn:[Save] to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

=== Site Template
{bl}
The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/stylesheets[`docs/stylesheets`] are the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS[CSS stylesheets] of the site.
You can modify them to change some properties of the site's design.

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] controls the rendering of `.adoc` files into HTML5.
These template files are written in a mixture of https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby] and http://slim-lang.com[Slim].

[WARNING]
====
Modifying the template files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] requires some knowledge and experience with Ruby and Asciidoctor's API.
You should only modify them if you need greater control over the site's layout than what stylesheets can provide.
