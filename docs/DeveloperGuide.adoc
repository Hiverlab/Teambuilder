== Introduction
This Bridgewater tool _TeamBuilder_ was inspired by office tools adopted by Bridgewater Associates, one of the largest
investment management companies in America. Their CEO and founder, Ray Dalio, heavily emphasises on radical transparency
and algorithmic decision when it comes to managing a company.

One such tool that inspired us was the “Baseball cards”, a profiling tool that highlights a person’s strengths and their
characteristics. Along with a “combiner” feature, the tool will be able to compare and analyse the key characteristics
of each employee. It will help you to find the right person for the job based on their strengths.

Thus, with that, _TeamBuilder_ was created with the aim of improving the allocation of human resources to projects at
Hiverlab Pte Ltd. With the Gallup StrengthsFinder test in mind, _TeamBuilder_ aims to delegate desirable team members in
an efficient manner by leveraging on one another’s strengths.

This developer guide specifies the design and implementation of _TeamBuilder_. The intended audience of this document is
the developers, designers and software testers of our application.

[.text-justify]
== Setting Up

Before starting, ensure that you have the following installed:

. Node.js
. Npm (Node Package Manager)
. Then, download the project (from Github & link to the Firebase console in your computer)

Else, please follow the steps below:

=== Verifying the setup

. ng serve(?) and see if everything is okay

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, the documentation will still refer to the `geezlouisee\bridgewater` repo.

If you plan to develop this fork as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to `TeamBuilder`), you should do the following:

. Replace the URL in the attribute `[fuchsia]#repoURL#` in link:{repoURL}/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[`[blue]#DeveloperGuide.adoc#`]
and link:{repoURL}/docs/UserGuide.adoc[`[blue]#UserGuide.adoc#`] with the URL of your fork.

=== Angular

=== Firebase

. Install the Firebase CLI
. Initialise your project
. Deploy to your site

For more information about setting up Firebase and connecting it to the project on the Firebase console, you may want to
refer to Firebase’s documentation https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/quickstart[here].

[.text-justify]
== Design

_TeamBuilder_ is designed to be a web app, implemented using an Angular framework. More details on its implementation will
be provided in Chapter 4.

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

As Angular is largely based on the Model-View-Controller (MVC) framework, this makes it convenient for front-end testing
for _TeamBuilder_ .

.Architecture Diagram of TeamBuilder
image::architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* above explains the high-level design of _TeamBuilder_.
Given below is a quick overview of each component.

* *Model*: Corresponds to all data-related logic that the user works with.
* *View*: Used for the UI logic of the application. Includes the html/css/ts files.
* *Controller*: Acts as an interface between Model and View components, it manipulates data using the Model component
and interact with the Views to render the final output.

Additionally, due to the Angular framework, the architecture of TeamBuilder is also largely component-based.
Each component consists of some metadata, an HTML template and logic - all of which controls a patch of screen called a
view.

<<<
[.text-justify]
== Implementation

TeamBuilder was made using HTML/CSS/TS and is largely implemented based on the Angular framework.
This framework was chosen to make the code cleaner, as compared to not using any Javascript frameworks at all.

This section describes in detail the implementation of certain features in _TeamBuilder_.

=== HTML/CSS
TeamBuilder was made using a free template that is already supported by Angular by Creative Tim.
Their source code can be found https://demos.creative-tim.com/paper-kit-2-angular/#/home[here].

=== Firebase

=== Combiner

== Documentation
{bl}
We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

{bl}
[.text-justify]
=== Editing Documentation
{bl}
See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, [blue]#UsingGradle.adoc#>> to learn how to render `[fuchsia]#.adoc#` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `[fuchsia]#.adoc#` files in real-time.

{bl}

=== Publishing Documentation
{bl}
See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, [blue]#UsingTravis.adoc#>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

{bl}

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format
{bl}
We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop[[blue]#Google Chrome#] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, [blue]#UsingGradle.adoc#>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `[fuchsia]#docs/#` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `[fuchsia]#build/docs#` folder, right click on them and select menu:Open With[Google Chrome].
.  Within Chrome, click on the btn:[Print] option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to btn:[Save as PDF], then click btn:[Save] to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

[[Docs-SiteWideDocSettings]]
=== Site-wide Documentation Settings
{bl}
The link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`[blue]#build.gradle#`] file specifies some project-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[ [blue]_asciidoc attributes_] which affects how all documentation files within this project are rendered.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in the `[fuchsia]#build.gradle#` file will use their *default value*, if any.

{bl}

[cols="1,2a,1", options="header"]
.List of site-wide attributes
|===
|Attribute name |Description |Default value

|`[fuchsia]#site-name#`
|The name of the website.
If set, the name will be displayed near the top of the page.
|_not set_

|`[fuchsia]#site-githuburl#`
|URL to the site's repository on https://github.com[[blue]#GitHub#].
Setting this will add a "View on GitHub" link in the navigation bar.
|_not set_

|`[fuchsia]#site-seedu#`
|Define this attribute if the project is an official SE-EDU project.
This will render the SE-EDU navigation bar at the top of the page, and add some SE-EDU-specific navigation items.
|_not set_

|===

<<<
[[Docs-PerFileDocSettings]]
=== Per-file Documentation Settings
{bl}
Each `[fuchsia]#.adoc#` file may also specify some file-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[[blue]_asciidoc attributes_] which affects how the file is rendered.

Asciidoctor's https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#builtin-attributes[[blue]_built-in attributes_] may be specified and used as well.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in `[fuchsia]#.adoc#` files will use their *default value*, if any.

{bl}

[cols="1,2a,1", options="header"]
.List of per-file attributes, excluding Asciidoctor's built-in attributes
|===
|Attribute name |Description |Default value

|`[fuchsia]#site-section#`
|Site section that the document belongs to.
This will cause the associated item in the navigation bar to be highlighted.
One of: `[fuchsia]#UserGuide#`, `[fuchsia]#DeveloperGuide#`, ``[fuchsia]#LearningOutcomes#``{asterisk}, `[fuchsia]#AboutUs#`, `[fuchsia]#ContactUs#`

_{asterisk} Official SE-EDU projects only_
|_not set_

|`[fuchsia]#no-site-header#`
|Set this attribute to remove the site navigation bar.
|_not set_

|===

<<<
=== Site Template
{bl}
The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/stylesheets[`[blue]#docs/stylesheets#`] are the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS[[blue]#CSS stylesheets#] of the site.
You can modify them to change some properties of the site's design.

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`[blue]#docs/templates#`] controls the rendering of `[fuchsia]#.adoc#` files into HTML5.
These template files are written in a mixture of https://www.ruby-lang.org[[blue]#Ruby#] and http://slim-lang.com[[blue]#Slim#].

[WARNING]
====
Modifying the template files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`[blue]#docs/templates#`] requires some knowledge and experience with Ruby and Asciidoctor's API.
You should only modify them if you need greater control over the site's layout than what stylesheets can provide.

[[Testing]]
== Testing

{bl}

=== Running Tests
{bl}
There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

{bl}
*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `[fuchsia]#src/test/java`# folder and choose `[fuchsia]#Run 'All Tests'#`.
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `[fuchsia]#Run 'ABC'#`.

{bl}
*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `[fuchsia]#gradlew clean allTests#` (Mac/Linux: `[fuchsia]#./gradlew clean allTests#`).

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, [blue]#UsingGradle.adoc#>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

{bl}
*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[[blue]#TestFX#] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `[fuchsia]#gradlew clean headless allTests#` (Mac/Linux: `./[fuchsia]#gradlew clean headless allTests#`).

<<<
=== Types of tests
{bl}
We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire application by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `[fuchsia]#systemtests#` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `[fuchsia]#seedu.finance.ui#` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
[navy]#e.g.# `[fuchsia]#seedu.finance.commons.StringUtilTest#`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
[navy]#e.g.# `[fuchsia]#seedu.finance.storage.StorageManagerTest#`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
[navy]#e.g.# `[fuchsia]#seedu.finance.logic.LogicManagerTest#`

{bl}

=== Troubleshooting Testing
{bl}
**Problem: `[fuchsia]#HelpWindowTest#` fails with a `[fuchsia]#NullPointerException#`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `[fuchsia]#HelpWindow.html#` in `[fuchsia]#src/main/resources/docs#` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `[fuchsia]#processResources#`.

{bl}

=== Build Automation
{bl}
See <<UsingGradle#, [blue]#UsingGradle.adoc#>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

{bl}

=== Continuous Integration
{bl}
We use https://travis-ci.org[[blue]#Travis CI#] and https://www.appveyor.com[[blue]#AppVeyor#] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, [blue]#UsingTravis.adoc#>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, [blue]#UsingAppVeyor.adoc#>> for more details.

{bl}

=== Coverage Reporting
{bl}
We use https://coveralls.io[[blue]#Coveralls#] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, [blue]#UsingCoveralls.adoc#>> for more details.

{bl}

=== Documentation Previews
{bl}
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com[[blue]#Netlify#] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, [blue]#UsingNetlify.adoc#>> for more details.

{bl}

<<<
=== Making a Release
{bl}
Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`[blue]#MainApp.java#`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, [blue]#using Gradle#>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. [navy]#e.g.# `[fuchsia]#v0.1#`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases[[blue]#Create a new release using GitHub#] and upload the JAR file you created.

{bl}

=== Managing Dependencies
{bl}
A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, _In-Credit-Ble_ depends on the https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson[[blue]#Jackson library#] for JSON parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives:

[loweralpha]
. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size)
. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)
